# Ignore uploaded enemy images but keep the initial versions
# This allows the default images to be included in the repository
# while ignoring any subsequent uploads

# First, track the initial versions of enemy images
# This ensures they're included in the repository
# Note: If these files are already tracked, you'll need to run:
# git add -f app/images/fruit/enemy.png app/images/fruit/enemy.jpg app/images/fruit/enemy-1.png app/images/fruit/enemy-1.jpg app/images/fruit/enemy-2.png app/images/fruit/enemy-2.jpg

# Then, ignore future changes to these files
# This prevents subsequent uploads from being tracked
app/images/fruit/enemy*
